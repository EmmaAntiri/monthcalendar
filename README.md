# Month Calendar

An illustration of using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** to make a _simple website_. The program dynamically draws out the days of the month mapped to days of the week for every month and updates everyday.

## HTML

HTML provides structure to the website.

## CSS

CSS provides styling to the website. The following are examined:

- The Flexbox (`display: flex`)
  - `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, `align-items`
- hover condition such as `.days div:hover`
- exempting a related tag such as `.days div:hover:not(empty)`

## JavaScript

The JavaScript provides interactivity in the website. The following are examined:

- Array
- Compound DOM selection such as `document.querySelector(".date h1")`
- `.innerHTML` vs `.innerText`
- for loop and reverse for loop
- `toDateString()` for converting dates to string.
- JavaScript XML (JSX) syntax such as days += `<div class="today">${i}</div>`
